# Vaultwarden
It's a fork form Bitwarden. You don't need a MySQL-DB, 'cause we're using SQLite.

# Important!
If you're facing issues, don't contact the Bitwarden-Devs, pls contact the Vaultwarden-Team (https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)

# Container-Storage
The data from your password-safe are stored within volumes (vw-data) inside the container.
